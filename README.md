# SharePoint_Buttons
A way to make buttons from a SharePoint Links List

This should work with SharePoint 2013+

Requires Jquery and SPServices (location can be adjusted in the buttons.htm file)

Add a content editor web part with the location being your buttons.htm file.
Create a Links List named Links and content from that List should appear on your page as buttons.
